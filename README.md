# Workflow scripts for Reaper
Simple custom Lua-scripts for Reaper which is made based on my own workflow needs. Maybe others will find them useful too!

## Scripts

#### JL_toggle activate monitor FX
Toggle activate/deactivate individually targeted FX or Containers on the monitor FX chain. Useful if you have a setup with special routings or use a plugin like the SonoBus plugin to monitor on different devices. Put it in the Reaper startup actions (requires SWS extension) to reset the state to default (off or on based on user config) when booting Reaper.<br>
<br>

<br>
###### User Config<br>
-- Define name of FX to toggle on/off.<br>
-- MUST be an exact match (except for upper and lower case letters)..<br>
<br>
<br>

#### JL_Create Resample Track
Inserts a new track that acts as a resampling track for 'live resampling' purposes. Audio input is based on currently selected track(s). If you are familiar with Abletons 'resampling input option' it is similar, with the main difference being that you choose the specific tracks you wish to receive audio from.<br>
<br>

<br>
###### User Config<br>
-- Set Track Height A in pixels(default).<br>
-- Set same track color. If several tracks selected the first selected track color is copied.<br>
-- Set track recording state if selected track is used as a midi instrument (midi input needs to be enable). true = Record: disable (input monitoring only). false = Record: input(audio or MIDI).<br>
<br>
<br>

-------
#### JL_Create FX Track
Inserts a new track that acts as an FX send. Audio input based on currently selected track(s).<br>
<br>
![create fx track gif](/gifs/JL_Create%20FX%20Track.gif)
<br>
###### User Config<br>
-- Set Track Height A in pixels(default).<br>
-- Set same track color. If several tracks selected the first selected track color is copied. If set to false a specified custom color will be used.<br>
-- Choose to place new FX track right below selected tracks or as last in tcp.
<br>

#### JL_toggle mute on items if same else mute
Toggle mute on selected media items with the following conditions: <br>
If the selected media items are all muted, then unmute all the selected media items.<br>
If the selected media items are all unmuted, then mute all the selected media items.<br>
If the selected media items are both muted and unmuted (they differ), then mute all the selected media items.<br>
<br>
![toggle mute gif](/gifs/JL_toggle%20mute%20on%20items%20if%20same%20else%20mute.gif)
<br>
###### User Config<br>
-- Bool. Set to true if item should unmute(instead of mute) if the selected item mute states don't match.
<br>
<br>

#### JL_latch preview - write to selection and set to trimread mode
Writes automation to selection (based on time selection) when toggling from latch preview to trim/read mode. Toggles between trim/read and latch preview on selected tracks automation mode. If latch preview mode is not selected it sets all tracks to trim/read mode (to prevent mistakes) and then sets the selected track to latch preview. If latch preview mode is selected it writes the changed values(changed during latch preview mode) to the track envelopes within the time selection, and then sets all tracks to trim/read mode, including the selected ones(to prevent mistakes).<br>
<br>

<br>

-------

#### JL_toggle selected tracks between trimread and latch
Toggles between trim/read and latch on selected tracks automation mode. If latch mode is not selected it sets the individual selected tracks to latch mode. If latch mode is selected it sets the individual selected tracks to trim/read mode.<br>
<br>
<br>

-------

#### JL_create time selection between items
This script creates a timeselection between to items in the arrange view. It uses default Reaper action commands to achieve this behaviour. The cursor needs to be placed between the two items where you want to create the time selection, since the script uses the cursor to achieve the desired behaviour. You can assign it to a mouse modifier of your choice.<br>
For example: Preferences/Editing Behavior/Mouse Modifiers: Track | Double-Click | Default Action<br>

### Set custom height actions - envelopes and tracks

<br>

#### JL_toggle track height on all visible tracks in tcp
Toggles between two different heights for visible tracks in tcp. It reads all the visible tracks height and if their height differs it sets all visible tracks to track_height_a. If track heights match each other and match either track_height_a or track_height_b it toggles to the opposite track height.
###### User Config<br>
-- Set Track Height A in pixels(default)<br>
-- Set Track Height B in pixels<br>
<br>
<br>

-------
#### JL_toggle track height on selected tracks in tcp if match
Toggles between two different heights for selected tracks in tcp. It reads the selected tracks height and if their height differs it sets all selected tracks to track_height_a. If track heights match each other and either track_height_a or track_height_b it toggles to the opposite track height.
###### User Config<br>
-- Set Track Height A in pixels(default)<br>
-- Set Track Height B in pixels<br>
<br>
<br>

-------

#### JL_toggle track height on selected tracks in tcp
Toggles between two different heights for selected tracks in tcp. It reads the individual selected tracks height and if it matches either track_height_a or track_height_b it individually toggles to the opposite one. If the tracks height matches neither it is set to track_height_a.<br>
###### User Config<br>
-- Set Track Height A in pixels(default)<br>
-- Set Track Height B in pixels<br>
<br>
<br>

-------

#### JL_read track height in pixels(utility)
Reads the height of a track in pixels and displays it in the reaper console. If several tracks is selected it displays an error message and do not get called.<br>
<br>
<br>

-------

#### JL_toggle envelope height on selected envelope lane
This script requires the SWS extension installed.<br>
Script functionality:<br>
Toggles between two different heights for the selected envelope. It reads the individual selected envelope height and toggles to the other one. If height does not match neither of the configurated envelope heights the bool default_envelope_a determines if set to a(true) or b(false). Thanks to Edgemeal for posting code snippets of reaper.BR_EnvAlloc on the Cockos forum.
###### User Config<br>
-- Set Track Height A in pixels(default)<br>
-- Set Track Height B in pixels<br>
-- Bool. Set to false if envelope should default to envelope_height_b instead of a.<br>
<br>
<br>

-------
#### JL_read envelope height in pixels(utility)
Reads the height of a selected envelope in pixels and displays it in the reaper console.<br>
